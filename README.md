# üß† Thyroid Cancer Recurrence Prediction

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts the **likelihood of thyroid cancer recurrence** using deep learning and a Streamlit-based web interface. This system helps in early risk assessment to support medical decision-making.

---

## üìå Project Overview

Thyroid cancer, though often treatable, has the potential for recurrence. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can assess recurrence risks based on patient demographics and clinical data using AI.

## üéØ Goals

- Train a robust machine learning model to predict thyroid cancer recurrence.
- Address class imbalance and optimize prediction threshold.
- Build an interactive web interface for real-time prediction.
- Help medical professionals with supportive decision-making tools.

## üìä Dataset Overview

The dataset contains anonymized patient records, including:

- **Demographics**: Age, Gender  
- **Medical History**: Smoking, Radiotherapy, Physical Examination  
- **Cancer Details**: TNM Staging, Pathology Type, Risk Classification  
- **Target**: Recurrence (`Yes` or `No`)

The dataset is **imbalanced**, with fewer "Yes" (recurrence) cases.

## üß™ Model Architecture

```python
model = Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.3),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
````

* **Loss Function**: Binary Crossentropy
* **Optimizer**: Adam
* **Output**: Probability of recurrence (thresholded to Yes/No)
